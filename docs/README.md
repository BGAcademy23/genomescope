# Genome profiling using GenomeScope

This session is part of [**Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023**](https://BGA23.org)

## Session Leader(s)

Lucía Campos-Domínguez  
Kamil Jaron

## Programme

- Introduction to k-mer spectra, their interpretation and running GenomeScope (lecture by Lucía, ~30')
- Ex. 1: Running and understanding genome models (~30')
- Looking under the hood of the GenomeScope model (lecture by Kamil, ~20')
- Ex. 2: Running GenomeScope-like model yourself in R; Using GenomeTelescope package (~20')
- Discussion/Interpretation of wild k-mer spectra (~20')
    - We will bring a bunch of examples; but feel free to bring your own wild k-mer spoectrum to share with others!

## Description

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Appreciate the art of the k-mer spectra gazing
2. Understand the idea behind genomescope model and its assumptions
3. Generate k-mer spectrum from a read set
4. Run GenomeScope in command-line and web-server
5. (if everything goes well) Create your own GenomeScope-like extended versions;

## Prerequisites

1. Basics knowledge of genomics
2. Be ready for some non-linear regression
3. (optional) familiarity with k-mers (Some materials developed by ourselves: <https://github.com/KamilSJaron/oh-know/wiki>)
4. (optional) Read relevant sections of <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14998-3>
